Cloud Inventory gives you dashboards for viewing all of your cloud resources in providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.

I built a fully-featured SaaS product. You can create an account, create admins within your account, grant Cloud Inventory read-only access to cloud providers, and drill into resources across providers.
